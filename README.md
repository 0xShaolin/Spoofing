# Spoofing
A collection of all the spoofing tools I have made in the past, to be updated frequently.

## Why are you doing this?
I have made countless spoofing tools over the past year and a half, keepng them under wraps for no real reason other than fear of script kiddies using it. However, the basic technique here that is applied to spoofing should be well known by now, and to those researchers who didn't know, they can delve deeper into the subject, same as I did.

## Why are the sms and mms spoofers different?
The main difference, if you read the code, is the absence of the email MIME library. This is simply because it is not necessary for the functionality of the SMS spoofer. I like to keep my code consise, and to avoid any possible bugs I kept the code **As-Is**. For the MMS spoofer, the library is essential, only due to needing to attach the image to the email.

## Where can I contact you with bugs or for assistance?
You can contact me at odinsecurity@protonmail.com, or submit an issue on this repository and I will tend to it as soon as possible.
